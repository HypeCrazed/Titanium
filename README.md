# Titanium
Lightweight video downscaler powered by FFmpeg.

**Supported video output and input formats:** ***.mp4 .mkv .mov .avi .wmv***

Using Titanium, you can cut your video size by more than half the original, great for services with file size limits like Discord.

You can downscale all the way to 800p 10fps, although support for even lower resolutions like 480p will be added soon.

What are you waiting for? Stop using those sketchy downscale websites and download Titanium.
