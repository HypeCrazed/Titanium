# Titanium
Lightweight video downscaler powered by FFmpeg.

**Supported video formats:** ***.mp4 .mkv .mov .avi .wmv***

**Todo list:** ***auto-updater***

#### If your antivirus is flagging Titanium as a virus, you can simply turn it off while using it.

Titanium requires the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-8.0.204-windows-x64-installer) to be installed.

Using Titanium, you can cut your video size by more than half the original, great for services with file size limits like Discord.

You can downscale all the way to 360p 10fps!

What are you waiting for? Stop using those sketchy downscale websites and download Titanium.
