# Titanium
Lightweight video downscaler powered by FFmpeg.

**Supported video formats:** ***.mp4 .mkv .mov .avi .wmv***

**Features in development:** ***TBD***

#### If your antivirus is flagging Titanium as a virus, you can simply exclude Titanium.exe and Titanium.dll, or turn it off while using Titanium.

Titanium requires the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-8.0.204-windows-x64-installer) to be installed.

Using Titanium, you can cut your video size by more than half the original, great for services with file size limits like Discord.

You can downscale all the way to 800p 10fps!

What are you waiting for? Stop using those sketchy downscale websites and download Titanium.

***If you're building from the source, make sure to put the FFmpeg files in the same folder as Titanium.exe***
